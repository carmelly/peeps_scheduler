## 🔁 Migrations

Schema changes are managed using migration files in `db/migrations/`.

### Running Migrations

```bash
python db/migrate.py
```

- Applies any unapplied `.sql` files in order
- Tracks applied files in the `__migrations_applied__` table
- Regenerates `schema.sql` using `sqlite3.exe` from the `db/` folder

> 💡 Tip: Download the SQLite CLI from https://sqlite.org/download.html and place `sqlite3.exe` in the `db/` folder.

## 🧯 Backups

Create timestamped backups and restore old database states.

### Create a Backup

```bash
python db/backup.py
```

Saves a backup like `20250407-1545_my_backup.db` in `db/backups/`.

### Restore a Backup

```bash
python db/backup.py --restore
```

Prompts you to select and restore a backup into `db/peeps_scheduler.db`.

### List Backups

```bash
python db/backup.py --list
```

## 🧼 .gitignore Recommendations

```gitignore
db/peeps_scheduler.db
db/backups/*.db
db/sqlite3.exe
```

## 🧠 Tips

- Keep `schema.sql` versioned, but don’t edit it directly — it's generated by `migrate.py`
- Use backups before major changes or imports
- Each migration file should be **pure SQL**, applied exactly once
